<h1>About Us</h1>
<p>At the Cake Shop, we believe that every celebration deserves a touch of sweetness. Our passion lies in crafting delightful, custom-made cakes that not only taste heavenly but also become cherished memories for our customers.</p>
<p>Founded by Jane Doe, Cake Shop has been sprinkling joy into people’s lives for over a decade. Jane’s journey began in her grandmother’s cozy kitchen, where she learned the art of baking from scratch. Her love for creating beautiful confections blossomed, and she decided to turn her passion into a business.</p>
<p>What Sets Us Apart</p>
